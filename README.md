# Constructor-Word-Guess

Has a busy couple of days of non-coding related activity so I just tried to get the main part of the assignment working since it was just an optional assignment. The constructers both are functional and the index.js file works in node so that it will correctly select a ranom word to construct and display the letters that have been guessed in the hidden word. To finish the program I would add the logic to the game so that it would count wrong guesses and have a losing condition, as well as an end of game message with an option to restart with a new random word or quit.
